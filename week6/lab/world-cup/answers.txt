Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Nothing seems to be wrong. It just becomes more stable.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
From 10,000 simulation and above, the results seem to be stabilizing
