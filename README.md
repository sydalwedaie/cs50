This is a repository containing lecture exercises, practice problems and assignmens from (Harvard's CS50 course)[https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/].

## Why did I take this course?
I'm on a journey to earn the equivalent of a computer science degree all on my own. I will be generally following the structure recommended in the Open Source Society University's (computer science)[https://github.com/ossu/computer-science] curriculum. Although it does not list CS50, I decided to take it due to it's incredible popularity as well as my own positive experience of the first lecture.
