# Harvard CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science

## What's here?
This is a repository containing lecture exercises, practice problems and assignmens from [Harvard's CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/).

## Why did I take this course?
I'm on a journey to earn the equivalent of a computer science degree all on my own. I will be generally following the structure recommended in the Open Source Society University's [computer science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum. Although it does not list CS50, I decided to take it due to it's incredible popularity as well as my own positive experience of the first lecture.

## What did I learn?
I had been dabbling with coding in general and JavaScript in particular for many years when I joined this course. Still, I started learning new things from the get go. Here's my progress as of April 2023:

### Week 0: Scratch
The course starts with some fundamentals about computers at a very low level. How the binary system works and how does a computer store text as well non-textual information using 0s and 1s. In a nutshell, text are *encoded* into bianry based on a set of man-made rules refered to as the **ASCII** standard. In it, the character 'A' is *mapped* to the number 65 (in binary, of course) and the number 0 to 48. We then got introduced to **Unicode** which was an attempt to break free of ASCIIs limited 128 character. Images are simply a serialized set of RGB values, again represented in binary, and finally video which is a serialized set of images. In the end, the programming language **Scratch** was introduced. I've known this program for many years but never really thought of it much. However, soon I realized people have been pushing it to it's limits!

For the week's project, I sat my goal way too high. Being a pilot, I wanted to create a rudimentary simulator where the player guides an airplain down a glide path, with pitch, roll and thrust controll. It wasn't far when I realized it wasn't feasable. It was funny but I realized how little I knew about the physics of flying. So I backed up and settled on a simple Altimeter emulator. I can show a climb or descent with adjustable QNH setting. As per the instructions, the project must have certain elements which were to be checked automatically when submitted. It was later when I learned a scratch program (file ending with .sb3) is really a packaged set of files: SVGs for the sprites, and a `project.json` files for the actual code. This is what the automated grading system would check to see if the project had met the requirements.

## What's my overal impression of the course?
Still in progress ðŸ™‚
