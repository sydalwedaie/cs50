Q. If `songs.db` contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
A. Running the query `SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs` shows:
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| AVG(energy) | AVG(valence) | AVG(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+

This person's energy and valence preferences are about the 0.5 mark, but enjoys music with high danceability.

Q. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
A. The list of the top 100 songs is heavily influence by the Spotify's algorithm that may not be fully aligned with a person's mood. Therefore, a listener may end up listening to a sogn that does not necessarily capture their inner feelings.
